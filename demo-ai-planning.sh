echo "🧪 AI Security Planning Demonstration"
echo "=================================================="
echo ""
echo "📋 User Request:"
echo "Target: https://sweetspotgov.com"
echo "Instructions: \"I want you to test against all subdomains and dir's. Test all access,"
echo "stuff like sql injection, sending JWT tokens, catching any leaky api's stuff like this.\""
echo ""
echo "=================================================="
echo "🤖 AI Initial Planning & Thought Process"
echo "=================================================="
echo ""

echo "Phase 1: Intent Classification"
echo "------------------------------"
echo "✓ Intent: Comprehensive security assessment"
echo "✓ Confidence: 95%"
echo "✓ Scope: Full subdomain and directory enumeration with vulnerability testing"
echo "✓ Key Areas: SQL injection, Authentication bypass, API security, Information disclosure"
echo ""

echo "Phase 2: Strategic Planning"
echo "---------------------------"
echo "The AI reasons: \"User wants comprehensive testing across all attack surfaces."
echo "Starting with reconnaissance to map the full attack surface, then targeted"
echo "vulnerability testing on discovered assets.\""
echo ""

echo "Phase 3: Test Prioritization"
echo "-----------------------------"
echo "Based on the request, here's the prioritized test plan:"
echo ""

echo "🎯 FIRST STEP - Subdomain Enumeration (Priority: CRITICAL)"
echo "Tool: subfinder"
echo "Command: subfinder -d sweetspotgov.com -all -recursive"
echo "Purpose: Discover all subdomains to identify the full attack surface"
echo "Expected Output: List of active subdomains like:"
echo "  - www.sweetspotgov.com"
echo "  - api.sweetspotgov.com"
echo "  - admin.sweetspotgov.com"
echo "  - dev.sweetspotgov.com"
echo "Duration: ~2-5 minutes"
echo ""

echo "📋 Complete Test Sequence:"
echo ""
echo "1. Reconnaissance Phase (15-20 minutes)"
echo "   ├─ Subdomain enumeration (subfinder, amass)"
echo "   ├─ Port scanning (nmap -sV)"
echo "   ├─ Directory discovery (gobuster, dirb)"
echo "   └─ Technology detection (whatweb, wappalyzer)"
echo ""
echo "2. Vulnerability Assessment Phase (30-45 minutes)"
echo "   ├─ SQL Injection testing (sqlmap on discovered forms/parameters)"
echo "   ├─ Authentication testing (JWT analysis, session testing)"
echo "   ├─ API endpoint discovery & testing (ffuf, postman)"
echo "   ├─ Information disclosure checks"
echo "   └─ XSS vulnerability scanning"
echo ""
echo "3. Targeted Exploitation Phase (20-30 minutes)"
echo "   ├─ Exploit confirmed SQL injections"
echo "   ├─ Test JWT token manipulation"
echo "   ├─ API authorization bypass attempts"
echo "   └─ Data exfiltration testing (safely)"
echo ""

echo "🛡️ Safety Considerations:"
echo "- Rate limiting to avoid DoS"
echo "- Non-destructive testing only"
echo "- Proper authentication where required"
echo "- Compliance with scope boundaries"
echo ""

echo "💭 AI Reasoning for First Step:"
echo "\"Subdomain enumeration is critical because:"
echo "1. It reveals the full attack surface"
echo "2. Hidden subdomains often have weaker security"
echo "3. Dev/staging subdomains may expose vulnerabilities"
echo "4. API endpoints are often on separate subdomains"
echo "5. It's non-invasive and safe to run first\""
echo ""

echo "📊 Expected Findings from First Step:"
echo "- 10-20 subdomains discovered"
echo "- Identification of development/staging environments"
echo "- API endpoint locations"
echo "- Potential admin panels"
echo "- Technology stack indicators from subdomain names"
echo ""

echo "🔄 Next Steps After Subdomain Discovery:"
echo "Based on findings, the AI would:"
echo "1. Prioritize interesting subdomains (api.*, admin.*, dev.*)"
echo "2. Run targeted scans on high-value targets"
echo "3. Adjust testing strategy based on discovered technologies"
echo "4. Focus deeper testing on most promising attack vectors"
echo ""

echo "=================================================="
echo "📁 This is what would be captured in a real test:"
echo "=================================================="
echo "- Full AI thought process and reasoning"
echo "- Detailed test execution plan"
echo "- Real-time progress updates"
echo "- Actual tool outputs and findings"
echo "- Dynamic strategy adjustments"
echo "- Complete audit trail for compliance"
