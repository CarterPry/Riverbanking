# 10/10 Exhaustive Testing is Now the Default

## What Changed

Per your feedback, the 10/10 exhaustive AI behavior is now the **DEFAULT** - no special test scripts or constraints needed!

### Core Changes to `strategicAIService.ts`:

1. **System Prompt** - Now explicitly states:
   ```
   CRITICAL DEFAULT BEHAVIORS (ALWAYS APPLY - NO EXCEPTIONS): 
   - EXHAUSTIVE TESTING IS THE DEFAULT - never group, always individual tests
   - Generate SEPARATE recommendation objects for EACH item/combo
   - Continue testing even if no vulnerabilities found
   - Use SecLists wordlists for all directory brute-forcing
   - Create combo tests between discovered assets
   - Minimum 5 recommendations in recon phase
   ```

2. **Phase Prompts** - Both recon and analyze phases now have:
   - Mandatory individual testing requirements
   - Clear examples (8 subdomains = 32+ recommendations)
   - Self-critique loops that check for exhaustive coverage
   - "This is the DEFAULT - not something the user needs to request!"

3. **Automatic Expansion** - The system now:
   - ALWAYS forces expansion in recon phase (removed the conditional check)
   - Ensures minimum 5 recommendations even without findings
   - Applies expansion to adapted strategies too
   - No longer requires `exhaustiveMode` or other special flags

4. **Analyze Phase** - Now explicitly continues testing:
   ```
   CRITICAL DEFAULT BEHAVIOR - ALWAYS CONTINUE TESTING:
   - Even if no vulnerabilities found YET, DO NOT STOP
   - The user wants EXHAUSTIVE testing - test EVERYTHING
   ```

## Result

Now when you run the simple test script:

```bash
./test-ai-first-step.sh
```

You'll automatically get:
- Individual recommendations for EACH subdomain (no grouping)
- Directory brute-forcing with SecLists on EVERY subdomain
- Port scanning on EVERY subdomain
- Tech fingerprinting on EVERY subdomain
- Combo tests (SSRF, auth chains)
- Continued testing even without vulnerabilities
- 24-32+ recommendations for typical targets

## No More Special Scripts Needed

You can delete `test-final-10x10.sh` - it's no longer needed because:
- No special constraints required (`exhaustiveMode`, etc.)
- No special user intent message needed
- The 10/10 behavior is baked into the core system

## What This Means

The AI will now ALWAYS:
1. Create individual tests for every discovered asset
2. Use SecLists wordlists by default
3. Generate combo/chain tests
4. Continue testing exhaustively
5. Never group or summarize recommendations

This is the system's default behavior - true 10/10 exhaustive autonomous reasoning out of the box!
