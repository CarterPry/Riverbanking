# WebSocket Disconnection Debug Summary

## Issue
The WebSocket connection disconnects immediately when loading a completed workflow in the dashboard.

## Key Findings
1. **Direct HTML test**: WebSocket stays connected for 11+ minutes (backend is working correctly)
2. **React Dashboard**: Disconnects immediately after receiving workflow-status message for completed workflows
3. **Pattern**: Connect → Receive status → Immediate disconnect

## Fixes Applied

### Backend (`backend/src/index.ts`)
1. ✅ Fixed `pingInterval` ReferenceError by declaring it at the top of connection handler
2. ✅ Added WebSocket server error handling and upgrade logging
3. ✅ Enhanced logging for message sizes and connection lifecycle
4. ✅ Explicit note to NOT close connection for completed workflows

### Frontend WebSocket Utility (`frontend/src/utils/websocket.ts`)
1. ✅ Removed blocking `alert()` calls that could interfere with event loop
2. ✅ Enhanced close event logging with code, reason, and connection state
3. ✅ Improved reconnection logic to avoid reconnecting on normal closures (code 1000)
4. ✅ Added connection state tracking

### Frontend Dashboard Component (`frontend/src/components/Dashboard.tsx`)
1. ✅ Added WebSocket ref (`wsRef`) to properly manage connection lifecycle
2. ✅ Added completed workflow tracking ref (`isCompletedRef`)
3. ✅ Enhanced error handling with try-catch around message processing
4. ✅ Added component lifecycle logging

### Frontend Dashboard Page (`frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`)
1. ✅ Added support for workflowId from URL params (not just location state)
2. ✅ Added render logging to track re-renders

## Test Tools Created
1. `test-direct-ws.html` - Direct WebSocket test (proves backend works)
2. `test-ws-minimal.html` - Minimal WebSocket test with manual controls
3. `test-continuous.js` - Puppeteer-based automated testing (requires puppeteer)

## Current Status
- Backend WebSocket server is stable and working correctly
- Issue appears to be React-specific (component lifecycle or state management)
- Enhanced logging should reveal the exact cause

## Next Steps
1. Check browser console for:
   - Component re-render patterns
   - WebSocket close codes and reasons
   - Any error messages during message processing

2. Look for in backend logs:
   - Message sizes (could be too large)
   - Connection/disconnection patterns
   - Any errors during message sending

3. If issue persists, consider:
   - Implementing message chunking for large payloads
   - Adding a delay before sending completed status
   - Using a different state management approach
