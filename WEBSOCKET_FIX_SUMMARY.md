# WebSocket Disconnection Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Redundant WebSocket Upgrade Handler** âœ…
- **Problem**: The `server.on('upgrade')` handler was interfering with WebSocket's automatic upgrade handling
- **Fix**: Removed the redundant handler - WebSocket server handles upgrades automatically when attached to HTTP server

### 2. **Property Name Mismatch** âœ…
- **Problem**: Backend stores `workflow.results` but WebSocket code was trying to send `workflow.result`
- **Fix**: Changed all references from `workflow.result` to `workflow.results`

### 3. **Missing Workflow Completed Event** âœ…
- **Problem**: When workflows complete, no event was emitted to notify connected clients with the results
- **Fix**: Added `workflow:completed` event emission in MCPServer and listener in main server

### 4. **Frontend Not Handling Completed Workflows** âœ…
- **Problem**: Dashboard wasn't handling `workflow-update` messages with completed status
- **Fix**: Added handler for `workflow-update` messages with `event: 'completed'`

## Current Status

The WebSocket connection is now stable! When you:
1. Submit a test through the form
2. Navigate to the dashboard
3. The WebSocket will:
   - Connect successfully
   - Receive the workflow status
   - Display results if the workflow is completed
   - Show "not found" if the workflow doesn't exist (instead of disconnecting)

## Test Instructions

1. **Start Fresh**:
   ```bash
   cd backend && npm run dev
   ```

2. **Submit a Test**:
   - Go to http://localhost:3001
   - Enter target: `https://sweetspot.so`
   - Select test type: Comprehensive
   - Add description
   - Click "Run Security Test"

3. **View Results**:
   - You'll be automatically redirected to the dashboard
   - The WebSocket will connect and stay connected
   - Results will appear (in mock mode, this happens instantly)

## What's Different Now

Before:
- WebSocket would connect â†’ receive status â†’ immediately disconnect with code 1006
- Pattern repeated endlessly

After:
- WebSocket connects â†’ receives status â†’ stays connected
- If workflow is completed, results are included in the message
- If workflow not found, displays appropriate message (no crash)

## Next Steps

The only remaining issue is that workflows are stored in memory, so they're lost when the backend restarts. This can be fixed by:
1. Adding Redis/database persistence for workflows
2. Storing workflow results permanently
3. Loading active workflows on startup

But the WebSocket disconnection issue is **FIXED**! ðŸŽ‰
