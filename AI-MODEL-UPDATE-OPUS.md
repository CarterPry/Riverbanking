# AI Model Update: Claude 3 Opus

## Change Summary

The AI model has been updated from **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** to **Claude 3 Opus** for all security decision-making.

### Before:
```typescript
private model = process.env.ANTHROPIC_MODEL || 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022';
```

### After:
```typescript
private model = process.env.ANTHROPIC_MODEL || 'claude-3-opus-20240229';
```

## Model Comparison

### Claude 3 Opus (New)
- **Model ID**: `claude-3-opus-20240229`
- **Context Window**: 200K tokens
- **Strengths**: 
  - Most powerful reasoning capabilities
  - Best for complex analysis and nuanced decision-making
  - Excellent at following detailed instructions
  - Superior performance on security analysis tasks
- **Cost**: Higher than Sonnet (about 5x more expensive)
- **Speed**: Slower than Sonnet (but worth it for security decisions)

### Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Previous)
- **Model ID**: `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`
- **Context Window**: 200K tokens
- **Strengths**: Balanced performance and cost
- **Cost**: Lower
- **Speed**: Faster

## Why Claude 3 Opus?

For security testing and decision-making, Claude 3 Opus offers:

1. **Superior Reasoning**: Better at complex Chain-of-Thought reasoning
2. **Exhaustive Analysis**: More thorough in identifying all possible attack vectors
3. **Better Instruction Following**: More reliable at following the detailed security prompts
4. **Nuanced Security Understanding**: Better grasp of security implications

## Configuration

### Environment Variable Override
You can override the model using the environment variable:
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_MODEL="claude-3-opus-20240229"
```

### Supported Models
- `claude-opus-4-1-20250805` (current default)
- `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` 
- `claude-3-sonnet-20240229`
- `claude-3-haiku-20240307` (not recommended for security)

## Testing the Change

After restarting the backend, run a test to see the improved reasoning:

```bash
./test-directory-enumeration.sh
```

The AI should now provide even more thorough and detailed security analysis.

## Cost Considerations

Claude 3 Opus is approximately 5x more expensive than Sonnet:
- **Opus**: $15 per million input tokens, $75 per million output tokens
- **Sonnet**: $3 per million input tokens, $15 per million output tokens

For critical security testing, the improved quality justifies the cost.
