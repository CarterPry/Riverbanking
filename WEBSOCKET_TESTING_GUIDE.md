# WebSocket Testing Guide

## âœ… WebSocket Connection is Now Stable!

The WebSocket issues have been resolved. Here's how to test it in your application:

## Testing Steps

### 1. Access the Application
- Frontend: http://localhost:3001 (or 3002 if 3001 is in use)
- Backend: http://localhost:3000

### 2. Test WebSocket on Dashboard

1. **Create a new workflow:**
   - Go to the home page
   - Fill out the form with a target URL (e.g., `https://example.com`)
   - Submit the form
   
2. **Monitor the Dashboard:**
   - You'll be redirected to the Dashboard page
   - Open browser DevTools (F12) â†’ Console tab
   - You should see:
     ```
     âœ… WebSocket connected
     ðŸ“¨ Received: status { message: 'Connected to SOC2 Testing Platform', status: 'connected' }
     ```
   - The connection should remain stable (no disconnection/reconnection loops)

3. **Check for Real-time Updates:**
   - The Dashboard should receive real-time updates about workflow progress
   - Progress bar should update as the workflow runs
   - Status messages should appear in real-time

## What Was Fixed

1. **Docker Detection** âœ…
   - Docker services now properly initialize
   - No more mock mode fallback

2. **WebSocket Message Format** âœ…
   - Server messages match client expectations
   - Proper 'status' type messages

3. **CORS Configuration** âœ…
   - Supports multiple frontend ports (3001, 3002, 5173)

4. **Connection Stability** âœ…
   - Added ping/pong mechanism
   - Proper error handling

5. **Rapid Reconnection Prevention** âœ…
   - 200ms debounce prevents React re-render issues
   - Connections stay stable

## Debugging Tips

If you still see WebSocket issues:

1. **Check browser console** for error messages
2. **Check backend logs** for connection/disconnection patterns
3. **Verify both services are running:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000/health  # Backend
   curl http://localhost:3001          # Frontend
   ```

## Success Indicators

âœ… No "WebSocket disconnected" messages repeating
âœ… Single "WebSocket connected" message per Dashboard load
âœ… Real-time updates appear on Dashboard
âœ… Connection stays open for entire workflow duration
