# AI Prompt Update Complete ✅

## Changes Applied

### 1. Updated Strategic AI Service (`backend/src/services/strategicAIService.ts`)
- ✅ System prompt now emphasizes SOC2 expertise and OWASP guidelines
- ✅ Phase prompts use Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning
- ✅ Requires exhaustive enumeration of ALL discovered assets
- ✅ JSON-only output format enforced
- ✅ Fixed TypeScript linting errors

### 2. Created Test Scripts
- ✅ `test-ai-direct.sh` - Updated with comprehensive requirements
- ✅ `test-directory-enumeration.sh` - Focused on directory scanning
- ✅ `test-comprehensive-enumeration.sh` - Uses new AI prompts

### 3. Documentation Created
- ✅ `WHY-NO-DIRECTORY-SCANNING.md` - Explains the original issue
- ✅ `AI-PROMPT-UPDATE-SUMMARY.md` - Details the changes made

## Next Steps

1. **Restart the backend** to load the updated prompts:
   ```bash
   # Stop current backend (Ctrl+C if running)
   cd backend && npm run dev
   ```

2. **Run the comprehensive test**:
   ```bash
   ./test-comprehensive-enumeration.sh
   ```

## What to Expect

The AI will now:
- List EVERY subdomain found explicitly
- Plan directory scanning for EACH subdomain individually
- Test EVERY discovered endpoint
- Provide detailed reasoning for each decision
- Map all tests to OWASP categories

Example: If 8 subdomains are found, you'll see:
```
"I found 8 subdomains: [list all 8]
Planning directory enumeration:
- subdomain1: directory-scanner targeting subdomain1.sweetspotgov.com
- subdomain2: directory-scanner targeting subdomain2.sweetspotgov.com
... (for all 8)"
```

## Success Indicators

Look for in the AI's response:
- Explicit listing of all discovered items
- Individual test plans for each asset
- Comprehensive OWASP mapping
- No skipped tools without explicit reasoning

## Time Estimates

With exhaustive testing:
- Subdomain enumeration: 2-5 minutes
- Directory scanning per subdomain: 3-5 minutes
- Total for 8 subdomains: ~40-50 minutes

The time limit has been removed to ensure completion.
