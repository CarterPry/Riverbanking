# AI Planning Test Setup - Status Summary

## ✅ What's Been Created

### Test Scripts
1. **`demo-ai-planning.sh`** - Working demonstration of AI planning (no backend required)
2. **`test-ai-first-step.sh`** - Quick test script (requires backend)
3. **`incremental-ai-test.js`** - Comprehensive Node.js test with WebSocket monitoring
4. **`monitor-ai-planning.py`** - Python script with rich visual output
5. **`run-ai-planning-test.sh`** - Master runner with interactive menu
6. **`AI_PLANNING_TEST_GUIDE.md`** - Complete documentation

### Current Status
- ✅ All test scripts created and made executable
- ✅ Demo script works without backend
- ⚠️ Backend has compilation errors preventing full tests
- ✅ Fixed ES module issues in Node.js script
- ✅ Fixed UUID generation in bash script

## 🚀 Quick Start (What Works Now)

### 1. Run the Demo (No Backend Required)
```bash
./demo-ai-planning.sh
```

This shows exactly what the AI would plan when given your instructions:
- Target: `https://sweetspotgov.com`
- Instructions: "Test all subdomains, directories, SQL injection, JWT tokens, API leaks"

### 2. View the AI's First Step
```bash
cat ./ai-test-outputs/demo-ai-plan.json | jq '.'
```

## 📋 What the Demo Shows

The AI's planning process follows these steps:

1. **Intent Classification** (95% confidence)
   - Identifies: Comprehensive security assessment needed
   - Key areas: SQL injection, auth bypass, API security

2. **Strategic Planning**
   - Start with reconnaissance (map attack surface)
   - Then vulnerability assessment
   - Finally targeted exploitation

3. **First Step: Subdomain Enumeration**
   - Tool: `subfinder`
   - Command: `subfinder -d sweetspotgov.com -all -recursive`
   - Priority: CRITICAL
   - Reasoning: "Reveals full attack surface, hidden subdomains often have weaker security"

## 🔧 Backend Issues

The backend has TypeScript compilation errors that need fixing:
- Module import/export issues
- Type mismatches
- Missing dependencies

To run the full tests with real AI integration, the backend needs to be fixed first.

## 📁 Output Location

All test results are saved to: `./ai-test-outputs/`

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Fix backend compilation errors
2. Install missing npm packages
3. Run full integration tests with live AI

For now, use `./demo-ai-planning.sh` to see how the AI would respond to your security testing instructions!
