However, the lack of documented key findings warrants further investigation.\n\nCRITICAL FINDINGS SUMMARY\n• No critical vulnerabilities were explicitly identified\n• Multiple reconnaissance tests were performed, indicating thorough coverage\n• Testing focused on infrastructure (ports, subdomains) and application layers (JWT, SSL)\n\nKEY RECOMMENDATIONS\n1. Enhance documentation of findings and test results\n2. Implement continuous security testing across all identified domains\n3. Establish clearer metrics for security findings classification\n\nSOC2 COMPLIANCE GAPS\nInsufficient data to determine specific SOC2 compliance gaps. Recommend additional compliance-focused testing.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n1. Conduct follow-up targeted testing for areas with incomplete results\n2. Implement structured documentation process for security findings\n3. Develop metrics-based security monitoring program\n4. Schedule quarterly reassessment of critical systems\n\nNote: This assessment appears to be preliminary or incomplete given the limited documented findings despite multiple test executions. A more detailed assessment is recommended for comprehensive security assurance.","owaspCoverage":{"A01:2021":3,"A02:2021":1,"A03:2021":0,"A04:2021":0,"A05:2021":6,"A06:2021":3,"A07:2021":0,"A08:2021":0,"A09:2021":0,"A10:2021":0},"ccControlsCovered":[],"auditReport":{"workflowId":"9622c95f-0ac2-4a8a-ac61-af0bc6b173f5","startTime":"2025-08-07T07:28:35.847Z","endTime":"2025-08-07T07:29:29.032Z","totalDecisions":10,"decisionsByType":{"strategy":1,"test-selection":9},"averageConfidence":1,"lowConfidenceDecisions":[],"criticalDecisions":[],"overriddenDecisions":[],"timeline":[{"timestamp":"2025-08-07T07:28:35.847Z","type":"strategy","summary":"Planned 0 tests for initialization phase","confidence":1,"impact":"medium"},{"timestamp":"2025-08-07T07:29:00.614Z","type":"test-selection","summary":"Selected subdomain-scanner tool with 1.00 confidence","confidence":1,"impact":"low"},{"timestamp":"2025-08-07T07:29:21.027Z","type":"test-selection","summary":"Selected directory-scanner tool with 1.00 confidence","confidence":1,"impact":"low"},{"timestamp":"2025-08-07T07:29:22.428Z","type":"test-selection","summary":"Selected directory-scanner tool with 1.00 confidence","confidence":1,"impact":"low"},{"timestamp":"2025-08-07T07:29:22.699Z","type":"test-selection","summary":"Selected port-scanner tool with 1.00 confidence","confidence":1,"impact":"low"},{"timestamp":"2025-08-07T07:29:23.986Z","type":"test-selection","summary":"Selected tech-fingerprint tool with 1.00 confidence","confidence":1,"impact":"low"},{"timestamp":"2025-08-07T07:29:24.174Z","type":"test-selection","summary":"Selected crawler tool with 1.00 confidence","confidence":1,"impact":"low"},{"timestamp":"2025-08-07T07:29:24.464Z","type":"test-selection","summary":"Selected port-scanner tool with 1.00 confidence","confidence":1,"impact":"low"},{"timestamp":"2025-08-07T07:29:24.652Z","type":"test-selection","summary":"Selected directory-scanner tool with 1.00 confidence","confidence":1,"impact":"low"},{"timestamp":"2025-08-07T07:29:29.032Z","type":"test-selection","summary":"Selected tech-fingerprint tool with 1.00 confidence","confidence":1,"impact":"low"}],"complianceSummary":{"totalTests":9,"testsWithApproval":0,"restraintsTriggered":0,"ccControlsCovered":[],"owaspCategoriesTested":[],"dataExposureRisk":false,"productionSafety":true},"recommendations":["Limited SOC2 control coverage.
