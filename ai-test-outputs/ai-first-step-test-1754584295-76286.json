The limited scope of findings suggests a generally stable security foundation, though further testing may be warranted.\n\nCRITICAL FINDINGS\n• No critical security vulnerabilities were identified\n• 8 non-critical findings detected during reconnaissance phase\n• Technology fingerprinting completed successfully\n\nKEY RECOMMENDATIONS\n1. Conduct additional penetration testing phases to ensure comprehensive coverage\n2. Review and document the 8 reconnaissance findings for potential hardening opportunities\n3. Implement continuous security monitoring to maintain current security posture\n\nSOC2 COMPLIANCE GAPS\nInsufficient data from current assessment to determine specific SOC2 compliance gaps. Recommend dedicated SOC2 readiness assessment.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n1. Review detailed reconnaissance findings\n2. Expand testing scope to include:\n   - Application security testing\n   - Infrastructure vulnerability assessment\n   - Access control review\n3. Develop remediation timeline for any identified issues\n4. Schedule quarterly reassessment\n\nNote: This assessment represents a point-in-time evaluation with limited scope. A more comprehensive security program may be necessary for complete risk assessment.","owaspCoverage":{"A01:2021":0,"A02:2021":0,"A03:2021":0,"A04:2021":0,"A05:2021":2,"A06:2021":1,"A07:2021":0,"A08:2021":0,"A09:2021":0,"A10:2021":0},"ccControlsCovered":[],"auditReport":{"workflowId":"7f047504-2b8f-4bcb-8110-65c152a63980","startTime":"2025-08-07T16:31:35.981Z","endTime":"2025-08-07T16:32:14.475Z","totalDecisions":4,"decisionsByType":{"strategy":1,"test-selection":3},"averageConfidence":1,"lowConfidenceDecisions":[],"criticalDecisions":[],"overriddenDecisions":[],"timeline":[{"timestamp":"2025-08-07T16:31:35.981Z","type":"strategy","summary":"Planned 0 tests for initialization phase","confidence":1,"impact":"medium"},{"timestamp":"2025-08-07T16:31:54.394Z","type":"test-selection","summary":"Selected subdomain-scanner tool with 1.00 confidence","confidence":1,"impact":"low"},{"timestamp":"2025-08-07T16:32:13.199Z","type":"test-selection","summary":"Selected port-scanner tool with 1.00 confidence","confidence":1,"impact":"low"},{"timestamp":"2025-08-07T16:32:14.475Z","type":"test-selection","summary":"Selected tech-fingerprint tool with 1.00 confidence","confidence":1,"impact":"low"}],"complianceSummary":{"totalTests":3,"testsWithApproval":0,"restraintsTriggered":0,"ccControlsCovered":[],"owaspCategoriesTested":[],"dataExposureRisk":false,"productionSafety":true},"recommendations":["Limited SOC2 control coverage.
