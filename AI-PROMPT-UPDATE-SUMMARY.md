# AI Prompt Update Summary

## What Changed

### Previous AI Behavior
- Made selective tool choices (e.g., skipped directory scanning)
- Stopped early if no vulnerabilities found
- Did not exhaustively test all discovered assets

### New AI Behavior (With Updated Prompts)
The AI now follows a structured Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning process:

1. **Explicit Enumeration**: Lists ALL discovered items (every subdomain, endpoint, directory)
2. **Exhaustive Testing**: Treats EACH discovered asset as a separate target
3. **Comprehensive OWASP Mapping**: Considers all OWASP categories, even low-probability ones
4. **Structured Output**: JSON-only responses with detailed reasoning
5. **No Skipping**: Must rationalize any omissions explicitly

## Key Changes to Prompts

### System Prompt
```
You are a SOC2 pentesting expert following OWASP guidelines. 
Plan progressive tests: recon → analyze → safe exploit if approved.
```

### Phase Prompt Structure
```
Reason step-by-step (CoT):
1. Summarize context/history/findings (list ALL items explicitly)
2. Enumerate ALL relevant OWASP categories
3. For EACH category, hypothesize tests based on findings
4. Prioritize by impact/confidence
5. Check constraints/safety for each
6. Rationalize omissions
```

## Expected Results

### Example: If 8 Subdomains Found
The AI will now plan:
- Directory scanning on subdomain1.target.com
- Directory scanning on subdomain2.target.com
- Directory scanning on subdomain3.target.com
- ... (for all 8 subdomains)

### Example: If 3 Directories Found per Subdomain
The AI will plan:
- SQL injection testing on subdomain1.target.com/admin
- SQL injection testing on subdomain1.target.com/api
- SQL injection testing on subdomain1.target.com/config
- ... (for all directories on all subdomains)

## Running Tests with New Prompts

### Option 1: Basic Test (Updated)
```bash
./test-ai-direct.sh
```

### Option 2: Directory-Focused Test
```bash
./test-directory-enumeration.sh
```

### Option 3: Comprehensive Test (NEW)
```bash
./test-comprehensive-enumeration.sh
```

## Monitoring AI Decisions

Watch the backend logs to see the AI's Chain of Thought reasoning:
```bash
cd backend && npm run dev
```

Look for log entries showing:
- Detailed reasoning for each tool selection
- Exhaustive listing of all targets
- OWASP category mappings
- Safety considerations

## What This Fixes

1. **No More Skipped Tools**: Directory scanning will happen on ALL subdomains
2. **Complete Coverage**: Every discovered asset gets tested
3. **Better Reasoning**: Clear explanations for why each test is chosen
4. **OWASP Compliance**: Proper mapping to security categories
5. **Audit Trail**: Detailed reasoning for compliance requirements

## Important Notes

- Tests will take longer due to exhaustive coverage
- More findings expected due to comprehensive testing
- Better suited for thorough security assessments
- May generate more traffic (still rate-limited for safety)

## Backend Restart Required

For the new prompts to take effect:
```bash
# Stop current backend (Ctrl+C)
# Restart
cd backend && npm run dev
```

Then run any of the test scripts above.
